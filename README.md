## Course Details

These courses provided me with hands-on experience and technical knowledge, highlighting the transformative potential of AI across diverse fields. Each course demonstrated how AI can address real-world challenges and drive innovation.

### xPore: An AI-Powered App for Bioinformaticians

Explored xPore, an AI tool for detecting RNA modifications like m6A using Nanopore sequencing data. Learned data processing, Bayesian modeling, and validation methods.

### Learning from Biosignal

Analyzed biosignals like EEG for medical diagnostics, focusing on sleep stage classification using models such as DeepSleepNet and TinySleepNet. Covered signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and portable health monitoring systems.

### AI for detecting code plagiarism

Studied AI-based code clone detection with tools like Merry. Learned clone types, detection processes, and ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM). Applied BigCloneBench and code2vec for semantic analysis.

### Mental disorder detection from social media data

Learned to predict mental health disorders, such as depression, using social media data. Topics included feature extraction (e.g., LIWC) and supervised models like Random Forest.

### BiTNet: AI for diagnosing ultrasound image

Developed diagnostic skills using BiTNet with EfficientNet-B5 for ultrasound image classification. Explored auto pre-screening, data augmentation, and statistical evaluations.

### AI for arresting criminals

Examined YOLO-based real-time object detection for suspect and vehicle tracking. Covered YOLO architecture, NMS, and advancements like YOLOv8, enhancing public safety and police efficiency.
